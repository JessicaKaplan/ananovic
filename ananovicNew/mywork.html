          I consider myself an unusual designer because I only create custom
          made and unique clothes, like pieces of art, as I like to call them. I
          am happy to say that I experienced the joy of being appreciated and
          distinguished for this.

          <p>
            In april 2015 I had my debut as Ana Novic, launching my first
            official collection, "1".
          </p>

          <p>
            It contained atypical night gowns with original cuts, sexy curves
            and the original element: manually paintings, a unique thing
            worldwide.
          </p>
          <p class="col1TextRight">
            The paintings were made by my very good friend, Veronica. The
            Romanian press called our gowns “living paintings”. I still get
            requests for manually painted dresses from my clients.

          </div>
          <p>
            In november 2016 my second collection, “2” walked the charming rooms
            of an old storytelling style house in Bucharest.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was the first one in Romania to have a presentation with only one
            model,instead of 5-10, like you usually see, a model who dances
            during the presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Collection “2” is about the infinite power of a well-welded couple,
            about soulmates, about Yin and Yang and about love in dance steps.

          <p>
            I first created a prototype hemp jacket with the occasion of
            launching collection “1”.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was firstly worn by a Romanian artist, the singer Alexandra
            Ungureanu, who attended the event and who was noticed immediately by
            the local press.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following hemp jackets continued to surprise, as I set myself a
            goal for a period of several weeks, meaning that I told myself to
            create a hemp jacket per week and post it on my social media.

        <p>
          “Art meets nature” was a blast of colour, dance and emotion, that took
          fashion, hair styling and make-up to another level.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a deep nature lover and I appreciate everything that has to do
          with it, and most importantly it represents one of my biggest
          inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
          The models represented elements of nature. The decor was astonishing,
          as our team managed to completely transform an old hall into a floral
          fantasy themed paradise.
