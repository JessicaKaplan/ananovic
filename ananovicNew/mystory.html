            <h2>LET THE FABRIC DO THE TALK
            </h2>
            <p>My handcrafted designs have the origin in the fabric’s texture, pattern, composition and quality. The fine details found on an “Ana Novic” garment are carefully executed until they reach perfection and both you and me are satisfied with the result. </p>

            <h2>The designer that doesn’t draw</h2>
            <p>You might find it odd, but I prefer to directly cut the material and create what my mind and soul has to say to it. I let myself driven by my creativity, passion and dedication I have for fashion and its’ beauty. Then for the next step, I’ll need you to try it on so we can “sculpt” everything together, for the cloth to reach your exact measurements.</p>
