                I consider myself an unusual designer because I only create custom
                made and unique clothes, like pieces of art, as I like to call them. I
                am happy to say that I experienced the joy of being appreciated and
                distinguished for this.

            <h2 class="Acol1Title">Collection 1</h2>
            <div>
                <p>
                    In april 2015 I had my debut as Ana Novic, launching my first
                    official collection, "1".
                </p>

                <p>
                    It contained atypical night gowns with original cuts, sexy curves
                    and the original element: manually paintings, a unique thing
                    worldwide.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The paintings were made by my very good friend, Veronica. The
                    Romanian press called our gowns “living paintings”. I still get
                    requests for manually painted dresses from my clients.

            <p>
                In november 2016 my second collection, “2” walked the charming rooms
                of an old storytelling style house in Bucharest.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was the first one in Romania to have a presentation with only one
                model,instead of 5-10, like you usually see, a model who dances
                during the presentation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Collection “2” is about the infinite power of a well-welded couple,
                about soulmates, about Yin and Yang and about love in dance steps.
            </p>

        <div class="Aleft4">
           
                <h2 class="AhempTitle">Hemp jackets</h2>
            
            <div>
                <p>
                    I first created a prototype hemp jacket with the occasion of
                    launching collection “1”.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It was firstly worn by a Romanian artist, the singer Alexandra
                    Ungureanu, who attended the event and who was noticed immediately by
                    the local press.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The following hemp jackets continued to surprise, as I set myself a
                    goal for a period of several weeks, meaning that I told myself to
                    create a hemp jacket per week and post it on my social media.

            <h2 class="AartTitle">Art meets nature</h2>
        <div>
        <p>
            “Art meets nature” was a blast of colour, dance and emotion, that took
            fashion, hair styling and make-up to another level.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am a deep nature lover and I appreciate everything that has to do
            with it, and most importantly it represents one of my biggest
            inspiration.
        </p>
        <p>
            The models represented elements of nature. The decor was astonishing,
            as our team managed to completely transform an old hall into a floral
            fantasy themed paradise.
